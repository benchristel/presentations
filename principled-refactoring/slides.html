![cover of Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, by Martin Fowler](refactoring-book.jpg)

???

The theme of this talk is Refactoring.

Refactoring's an idea that's been around for a while.
Martin Fowler published the seminal book on Refactoring in
1999, but he says the technique is older than that. He just
documented it.

But the strength of Fowler's book, in my opinion, is that
he gives us a vocabulary for talking about refactoring.

First and foremost, he defines Refactoring itself, as

He also identifies this notion of refactorINGS, which
are the little atomic changes we do to code to clean it up.

But most importantly, he tells us why refactoring is
valuable. Refactoring lowers the cost of enhancements.

✅ &nbsp;High-level values (ease of change)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...

✅ &nbsp;Low-level techniques (refactorings)

I think at this point, the software industry has
internalized both the value of maintainable code
and the low-level techniques of refactoring.

---

class: middle

✅ &nbsp;High-level values (ease of change)

❓&nbsp;Strategy

✅ &nbsp;Low-level techniques (refactorings)

???

What I think is missing from the conversation though is
discussion of **strategy**. We may value code that's
easy to change, and we may know procedurally how to
refactor, but that doesn't tell us which refactorings to
apply at any given moment as we're working.

Refactoring often feels like a maze of paths with no clear
exit. It's hard to know which way to go, and even hard to
know when we've reached the goal.

So, because of the distance between values and practices,
we need some way to bridge the gap between them. In Extreme
Programming Explained, Kent Beck introduces the concept of
principles as the bridge between values and practice.

my attempt to bridge that gap.

### Refactoring already has principles!

???

You might say, "wait a minute, refactoring already has
principles!" or at least, *a* principle.

---

class: center, middle

## DRY

Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself

???

DRY, right? Don't repeat yourself!

So let's see how DRY works with a code example.

---

### A DRY refactoring:

```javascript
  function getCommandLineArgs(cfg, ENV) {
    let libargs = ""
    if (cfg.libs) {
      let index = 0
      for (const lib of cfg.libs) {
        libargs += `-l${esc(lib)}`
        if (index < cfg.libs.length - 1) {
          libargs += " "
        }
        index++
      }
      return libargs
    } else if (cfg.libdir) {
      return `-L${esc(cfg.libdir)}`
    } else if (cfg.libdirs) {
      let index = 0
      for (const libdir of cfg.libdirs) {
        libargs += `-L${esc(libdir)}`
        if (index < cfg.libdirs.length - 1) {
          libargs += " "
        }
        index++
      }
      return libargs
    }
    return `-L/home/${ENV.USER}/lib`
  }
```

???

Here's the code that's the protagonist of today's talk.
What it does is it constructs some command line arguments
that are going to be passed to a compiler.

If we're using the DRY principle, the first thing we're
likely to notice about this code is these two obviously
duplicated chunks.

---

### A DRY refactoring:

```javascript
  function getCommandLineArgs(cfg, ENV) {
    if (cfg.libs) {
      return buildArgString("-l", cfg.libs)
    } else if (cfg.libdir) {
      return `-L${esc(cfg.libdir)}`
    } else if (cfg.libdirs) {
      return buildArgString("-L", cfg.libdirs)
    }
    return `-L/home/${ENV.USER}/lib`
  }

  function buildArgString(flag, args) {
    let ret = ""
    let index = 0
    for (const arg of args) {
      ret += `${flag}${esc(arg)}`
      if (index < args.length - 1) {
        ret += " "
      }
      index++
    }
    return ret
  }
```

???

So we pull those out into a function.

---

### A DRY refactoring:

```javascript
  function getCommandLineArgs(cfg, ENV) {
    if (cfg.libs) {
      return buildArgString("-l", cfg.libs)
    } else if (cfg.libdir) {
      return `-L${esc(cfg.libdir)}`
    } else if (cfg.libdirs) {
      return buildArgString("-L", cfg.libdirs)
    }
    return `-L/home/${ENV.USER}/lib`
  }

  function buildArgString(flag, args) {
    return args
      .map(arg => `${flag}${esc(arg)}`)
      .join(" ")
  }
```

???

Then we can do a replace loop with pipeline on that function
and we get this.

Then we notice that this line is pretty similar to this
line, so we pull out a function for that.

---

### A DRY refactoring:

```javascript
  function getCommandLineArgs(cfg, ENV) {
    if (cfg.libs) {
      return buildArgString("-l", cfg.libs)
    } else if (cfg.libdir) {
      return buildSingleArgString("-L", cfg.libdir)
    } else if (cfg.libdirs) {
      return buildArgString("-L", cfg.libdirs)
    }
    return `-L/home/${ENV.USER}/lib`
  }

  function buildArgString(flag, args) {
    return args
      .map(arg => buildSingleArgString(flag, arg))
      .join(" ")
  }

  function buildSingleArgString(flag, arg) {
    return `${flag}${esc(arg)}`
  }
```

???

And that's it! The code is idiomatic.
The duplication is gone. we're done.

I'm not going to claim that this isn't an improvement over
the original code, but I think we've gone up kind of a dead
end here. We've reached a local optimum from which it's
hard to see our way to a better design.

And this is the core of the problem with DRY as a principle.
DRY leads to
greedy optimizations that remove **obvious** duplication locally
while leaving quite a bit of **hidden** duplication globally.
Over time, that duplication sucks the life out of a
codebase.

But if we want to do better than this—and do better
**reliably**, not just by chance—we need some
additional principles to guide us.

---

class: center, middle

## Some additional principles

???

So here are some additional principles.

---

class: center, middle, black

.poem[
1. Directness
2. Symmetry
3. Rootedness
]

???

Directness, symmetry, and rootedness.

So for the rest of the talk, I'm going to define each of
these, and then I'm going to do a live refactoring demo on
the code we just saw so you can see how they work in
practice.

---

class: center, middle, black

## Directness

???

First, Directness.

Directness is a property of code.

By directness, I mean the absence of indirection.
Often when we're refactoring, it's tempting to extract new
functions at every opportunity. But every extracted function
adds indirection, and indirection imposes a cost on the
reader. Because now they can't just read the code, they
have to jump around.

---

class: middle

```javascript
buildArgString("-L", cfg.libdirs)
// ...
buildSingleArgString("-L", cfg.libdir)
```

???

Here's an example: this code, from the DRY refactoring we
just saw, has two functions. buildArgString actually calls
buildSingleArgString under the hood, so these two functions
are doing fundamentally the same kind of thing. But that
relationship is invisible to someone who's just looking at
these two lines. They might guess that these functions are
related, but they won't know for sure unless they look at
the implementation. The principle of directness says that
if we can save our readers that uncertainty, we should.

---

class: center, middle, black

## Symmetry

???

Principle 2 is symmetry.

Symmetry is another property of code.

Code that's symmetrical has a rhythm to it, a predictable
repeating structure.

---

class: middle

### Symmetrical Ruby

```ruby
download_class =
  case uri.scheme
  when "ssh"
    GitDownload
  when "https"
    HttpsDownload
  when "sftp"
    SftpDownload
  else
    raise NoSuitableClass, "No class for #{uri}"
  end

download_class.new(uri).execute!
```

???

Here's some symmetrical Ruby. This code downloads a file
from a URL and the first thing it does is choose an
appropriate downloader class. The case statement has a
simple, predictable structure—when string, class, when
string, class—and that makes it really easy
to see what's **different** about each case.

---

class: middle

### Asymmetrical Ruby

```ruby
if uri.scheme == "ssh"
  download_class = GitDownload
elsif uri.to_s.start_with? "https"
  download_class = HttpsDownload
end

download_class ||= SftpDownload if uri.scheme == "sftp"

raise NoSuitableClass, "No class for #{uri}" unless download_class

download_class.new(uri).execute!
```

???

To drive the point home here's some asymmetrical code
that does exactly the same thing. Here we're using every
**other** type of conditional Ruby has, and there's no
consistent pattern to it. You can't comprehend this code
at a glance.

---

class: middle

## WET Symmetry

```ruby
case uri.scheme
when "ssh"
  GitDownload.new(uri).execute!
when "https"
  HttpsDownload.new(uri).execute!
when "sftp"
  SftpDownload.new(uri).execute!
else
  raise NoSuitableClass, "No class for #{uri}"
end
```

???

Symmetry works best when it's DRY. Here's a third
implementation of that same code. Now instead of
instantiating the class and executing the download once,
we're doing it in each branch of the case statement. That
extra duplicated code is noise that makes it harder
to see the important differences embedded in the repetition.
So we want to keep our symmetry as DRY as possible.

---

class: center, middle, black

## Rootedness

???

The third principle is Rootedness. Unlike the other
principles, rootedness isn't a property of code. It's a
property of change.

When I say "rooted" I want you to think of "grassroots".
Rooted changes emerge organically from what's already there.
Rather than coming up with a vision for how the code should
look and then imposing it top-down, I'm going to ask the
code what _it_ wants to be.

> 1. Find the things that are most alike.
> 2. Select the smallest difference between them.
> 3. Make the smallest change that removes that
   difference.

<cite>Sandi Metz & Katrina Owen</cite>
]

???

That sounds kind of fuzzy-wuzzy and mystical, but it's
really not: there are **algorithms** for making rooted changes
to code, and here's one of them.

This is from _99 bottles of OOP_ by Sandi Metz and Katrina Owen.

It's three simple steps:

find the pieces of code that are most alike, the most
syntactically similar

Select the smallest difference between them,

and make the smallest change that removes that difference.
We want to make the things that are almost alike *exactly*
alike, and once they're exactly alike it's easy to remove
the duplication.

There are many possible algorithms for rooted change, but
I chose this one because it leads to code
that is DRY, direct and symmetrical. So it supports our
other principles.

The thing I like about algorithms for rooted change
is that you can pick them up pretty quickly and they don't
require a lot of creative insight to use. You can pretty
much just use them and see where they take you. Often I find
they show me solutions I never would have found just by
designing at a whiteboard.

```

???

Okay, let's reflect on where we ended up. The DRY refactoring
from earlier is on the right, the code we just refactored
is on the left. Let's compare them and see how we did.

First, let's consider the DRY principle. It seems like there's
no more duplication on the left than there is on the right,
so I'd say we've done pretty well on the DRY front.

Second, let's talk about directness. The code on the right has
three functions and five function calls, where the code on
the left has one and one, so I'd
say the code on the left is more direct. But notice that
even though it's one function, it's not monolithic. It
splits cleanly into two pieces. First, we decide what
data we're going to operate on. Then, we invoke a general
algorithm for processing that data. So we've managed to
organize our code into small comprehensible units, but
without introducing indirection, which I think is pretty
cool.

Third, let's look at symmetry. You'll
notice that both implementations make use of a chain of
conditional statements, but only the one on the left is
completely symmetrical. The default value on the right is a
special case, while on the left it's handled like all the
others.

Also note that the code on the right handles the singleton
`libdir` argument by calling a special function, while the
code on the left expresses singleness by wrapping the value
in an array and then just treating it like the other arrays.

### Is our newly-factored code really easier to change?

???

So our code is in line with the principles we set out,
but we need to tie it back to the value of refactoring:
lowering the cost of change. Is our newly-factored code
really easier to change?

I'd argue that yes it is, simply because it's easier to
read. We could spend time making up change requests that
each of these implementations would or wouldn't handle well,
but the fact remains that anyone who changes this code is
first going to have to understand it, so code that's
easy to understand has a distinct advantage.

## Correctness

???

However, maintainability is really just a
sideshow compared to the question of correctness.

## Shell Injection Alert!

  const [flag, args] = (() => {

    if (cfg.libdir) {
      return ["-L", [cfg.libdir]]
    }
    if (cfg.libdirs) {
      return ["-L", cfg.libdirs]
    }
    {
      return ["-L", [`/home/${ENV.USER}/lib`]]
    }
  })()

  return args
    .map(arg => `${flag}${esc(arg)}`)
    .join(" ")
}
```
]

.side-by-side.smaller-font[
```javascript
function getCommandLineArgs(cfg, ENV) {

  } else if (cfg.libdirs) {

function buildArgString(flag, args) {

    .join(" ")
}

function buildSingleArgString(flag, arg) {
  return `${flag}${esc(arg)}`
}
```
]

???

And the fact is, the code on the right has a security bug.
The code on the left does not.

Does anyone see it?

So here's the problem: If the USER environment
variable has a malicious script in it, it will be passed
through to the command line arguments without being escaped.
And probably executed downstream when the command runs.

This code doesn't have that problem, because we're escaping
everything, all in one place, right before it goes out the
door.

I don't know if there are any general lessons to be learned
here. However I do think it's interesting that a) this
very simple code contains a security hole even though I was
thinking about shell escaping when I wrote it, and b) I
fixed the bug by accident just by doing a principled
refactoring.
