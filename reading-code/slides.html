# Reading Code

???

My talk today is about reading code.

This might strike you as a strange subject for a talk.
"Reading code" seems like an almost trivial topic, like
something that's not worth discussing or thinking very
much about. We take it for granted that we can all look
at a chunk of code and eventually figure out what it does.

Certainly this was my attitude for a long time. I think it
was engrained into me by the way computer science was taught
when I was in college. I don't know if it's different now,
but when I learned CS, there was a lot of focus on
algorithms and design and programming languages, and almost
no focus on the procedural aspects of how to program—how to
use a text editor or an IDE effectively, for example. And
the result of that was that when I got out of college and
got my first programming job, the way I opened files in my
text editor was that I would hit command-O, which brought up
the operating system dialog for choosing a file, I would
browse through the folder structure to find the file I
wanted, and then I would click "OK". And my manager saw me
doing this and was like "wait a minute, stop, no. we have to
fix this. Your editor should let you open files by just
typing part of their name. And if it doesn't, we need to get
you a better editor." And so that was the day I learned how
to open a file. I'd been programming in school and as a
hobbyist for about 14 years at that point, and it had never
occurred to me to learn how to open a file—simply because I
didn't know what I was missing.

1. Using an editor is a _skill_.
2. Great programmers have _procedural_ as well as conceptual knowledge.

???

And so I actually learned two things from that experience.
First, that using an editor
is a skill that you can practice and get better at. I had never even thought to seek out a better way of
opening files. Second, that great programmers like my
manager have procedural knowledge as well as conceptual,
intellectual knowledge. They know how to do things, at the
level of tiny little micro-interactions with the software
they're using, and streamlining all those little interactions
lets them focus their mental energy where it really matters—on
the hard task of solving problems with code.

But this talk, of course, is not about opening files. There
are thousands of micro-skills we use
in our jobs that I'm not going to talk about. We're just going
to focus on reading code. And there are
a couple reasons I want to focus on reading to the exclusion
of other activities.

The first reason is that reading code is, empirically, what most
programmers spend most of their time doing.

In his book _Clean Code_, Bob Martin writes, &lt;read quote&gt;

So if we use the best tools we can for _reading_ code, we'll get
better and faster at programming. In comparison, there are relatively
few gains to be obtained by upgrading the tools we use
to _write_ code.

???

The second reason I want to focus on reading is that it
seems to me that the tools we
have for _understanding_ code are less used and less
appreciated than the tools for writing code. And that's
just because, if you're doing some editing task that
requires a lot of
repeated typing or error-prone manual changes, you'll
probably look for a tool to help you do it faster and more
reliably. But when we're reading code, on the other hand,
it's often much harder
to identify exactly where we are spending our effort or to imagine
how we might do better. However, I think that once I show
you some of these tools, you'll have no trouble thinking
of places to apply them.

So without further ado, let's look at some code.
