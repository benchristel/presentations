1. Mental Modeling is the Hard Part of Software Development

- the hard part of software development is building a useful mental model of the software, the problem it's solving, and its environment. A mental model is useful when enables you to predict and control the system's behavior as it evolves.
- goal: intellectual control
  - knowing what the system does, how, and why
  - backing up that knowledge with demonstrations and proofs (e.g. types and tests)
  - reasoning about the consequences of potential changes

2. Testable Designs Have Benefits Beyond Testing

- design for testing (and thus for grokking, repurposing, and extending)
-
- use mocks only as a last resort. message-based verification is usually not what you want.

3. You don't have to suffer inconvenient data formats

- rule out bad states early at runtime (parsing, type-driven design)


- clearly distinguish effectful, stateful, and purely functional code
- flatten hierarchies
- separate general-purpose, domain-specific, and app/architecture-specific code.
- algebraic properties
