# Two Patterns for Functional Refactoring in JavaScript

---

class: center, middle

# 1. Data Pipelines

--

# 2. Currying and Composition

???

One is data pipelines - like, Unix-style pipelines

Two is currying and composition, so I guess that's actually three.

In case you don't know what these terms mean:

---

class: middle

```javascript
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y
}

add(3, 4) // returns 7
```

???

Currying is when you have a function that takes multiple arguments like add x and y, and you rewrite it to take a sequence of calls instead, like this.

---

class: middle

```javascript
function add(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y
  }
}

add(3)(4) // returns 7
```

???

At first glance, this doesn't seem useful, but in part 2 I'll talk about why it's actually awesome.

If you're wondering how they came up with a word like "currying" for this procedure, it's actually named after

Composition in its broadest sense is just putting two independent things together to make a new thing. It occurs all over the place in both functional and object-oriented programming and it's very, very powerful.

In this talk we're going to be composing functions together to make new functions.

---

class: center, middle

# Functional Data Pipelines

???

So, let's talk about functional data pipelines!

---

class: center, middle

# I have a problem

???

I have a problem. I love Javascript.

But we can't solve that problem with functional data pipelines, so let's look at a different problem

---

class: center, middle

# I have a list of Muppets

---

class: center, middle

# I want to render it as HTML

---

class: middle

```javascript
var muppets = [
    {name: 'Kermit'},
    {name: 'Miss Piggy'},
    {name: 'Fozzie'}
]
```

???

Here's my list. An array of Javascript objects that each have a name property.

---

class: middle

```javascript
var muppets = [
    {name: 'Kermit'},
    {name: 'Miss Piggy'},
    {name: 'Fozzie'}
]
```

```html
<ol>
  <li>Kermit</li>
  <li>Miss Piggy</li>
  <li>Fozzie</li>
</ol>
```

???

And this is the HTML I want out.

Now, as soon as I see this problem I start thinking about how I could break it down into pieces that are easy to test. So here are the pieces I came up with

---

class: middle

1. Get the name of each Muppet
2. &nbsp;
3. &nbsp;
4. &nbsp;

```javascript
[
    'Kermit',
    'Miss Piggy',
    'Fozzie'
]
```

???

Get the name of each muppet. That gives me an array of names.

---

class: middle

1. Get the name of each Muppet
2. Wrap each name in an `<li>` tag
3. &nbsp;
4. &nbsp;

```javascript
[
    '<li>Kermit</li>',
    '<li>Miss Piggy</li>',
    '<li>Fozzie</li>'
]
```

???

Wrap each name in an LI tag

---

class: middle

1. Get the name of each Muppet
2. Wrap each name in an `<li>` tag
3. Join the tags with newlines
4. &nbsp;

```html
                                                                //
<li>Kermit</li>
<li>Miss Piggy</li>
<li>Fozzie</li>
                                                                //
```

???

Join them with newlines

---

class: middle

1. Get the name of each Muppet
2. Wrap each name in an `<li>` tag
3. Join the tags with newlines
4. Wrap in an `<ol>` tag

```html
                                                                //
<ol><li>Kermit</li>
<li>Miss Piggy</li>
<li>Fozzie</li></ol>
                                                                //
```

???

And finally, we wrap the whole thing in an ordered list

---

class: center, middle

# Each of these steps can be a function

???

- I want to make each of these steps a function,
- so I can unit test them individually
- so here are the functions I come up with

---

class: middle

```javascript
function getNames(muppets) {
                                                                //
                                                                //
                                                                //
                                                                //
                                                                //
}

function wrapInListItems(strings) {
                                                                //
                                                                //
                                                                //
                                                                //
                                                                //
}

function joinOnNewlines(strings) {           }

function wrapInOrderedList(string) {
                                                                //
}
```

---

class: middle

```javascript
function getNames(muppets) {
  var names = []
  for (var i = 0; i < muppets.length; i++) {
    names[i] = muppets[i].name
  }
  return names
}

function wrapInListItems(strings) {
  var lis = []
  for (var i = 0; i < strings.length; i++) {
    lis[i] = '<li>' + strings[i] + '</li>'
  }
  return lis
}

function joinOnNewlines(strings) { /* ... */ }

function wrapInOrderedList(string) {
  return '<ol>' + string + '</ol>'

    var _ = muppets

    _ = getNames(_)
    _ = wrapInListItems(_)
    _ = joinOnNewlines(_)

    _ =               (_)

        wrapInListItems
        joinOnNewlines

                                                                //

class: middle

```javascript
var compose = (f, g) => x => g(f(x))

var pipeline = f => g =>
  typeof g === 'function'
    ? pipeline(compose(f, g))
    : f(g)
```

---

class: middle

```javascript
var renderMuppets = pipeline
    (getNames)
    (wrapInListItems)
    (joinOnNewlines)
    (wrapInOrderedList)
```

---

class: middle

```javascript
function getNames(muppets) {
  var names = []
  for (var i = 0; i < muppets.length; i++) {
    names[i] = muppets[i].name
  }
  return names
}
```

???

The only thing that's different between these two is the operation we're performing inside the loop. 

Everything else is identical.

---

class: middle

```javascript
function wrapInListItems(strings) {
  var lis   = []
  for (var i = 0; i < strings.length; i++) {
    lis[i]   = '<li>' + strings[i] + '</li>'
  }
  return lis
}
```

???

---

class: middle

```javascript
function getNames(input) {
  var out = []
  for (var i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    out[i] = getName(input[i])
  }
  return out
}
```

???

We can pull out the parts that are different into functions, so now we have something like this.

Now these two functions are completely identical except for that one function call inside the loop

---

class: middle

```javascript
function wrapInListItems(input) {
  var out = []
  for (var i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    out[i] = wrapInListItem(input[i])
  }
  return out
}
```

???

We can pull out the parts that are different into functions, so now we have something like this.

---

???

So now, we have to make a quantum leap. We have to shift our thinking about this refactoring out of procedural-land into functional-land. In order to eliminate the remaining duplication we need a higher-order function - a function that takes another function as a parameter. That way we can inject the part that differs between these two operations into the part that stays the same.

Functional programming has a name for the specific higher-order function that we need. It's called `map`.

---

class: center, middle

# map

---

???

`getName` and `wrapInListItem` functions - the ones that operate on a single value - and upgrades them into functions that operate on arrays.

---

???

In both of these functions, the only thing that varies (besides the variable names), is the operation we perform on each element of the array. The rest is identical.

So we can extract a function that just does the iteration, and we can inject the per-item operation into it.

Functional programming has a name for this iterating function. It's called map.

---

class: center, middle

# `map`

???

We can define it like this:

---

class: middle

```javascript
function map(func, input) {
  var output = []

  for (var i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    output[i] = func(input[i])
  }

  return output
}
```

---

class: center, middle

# Mission Accomplished

---

class: middle

```javascript
function getName(muppet) {
  return muppet.name
}

map(getName, muppets)
// returns ['Kermit', 'Miss Piggy', 'Fozzie']
```

---

class: middle

```javascript
function renderMuppets(muppets) {
    var _ = muppets

    _ = map(getName, _)
    _ = map(wrapInListItem, _)
    _ = joinOnNewlines(_)

    var html = _
    return html
}
```

---

class: middle

```javascript
var renderMuppets = pipeline
    (getNames)
    (wrapInListItems)
    (joinOnNewlines)
    (wrapInOrderedList)
```

---

class: middle

```javascript
var renderMuppets = pipeline
    (map(getName, ???))
    (wrapInListItems)
    (joinOnNewlines)
```

```javascript
var renderMuppets = pipeline
    (map(getName, ???))
    (map(wrapInListItem, (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻))
    (joinOnNewlines)
```

---

class: center, middle

# `map`

class: middle

```javascript
var getNames = map(getName)
var wrapInListItems = map(wrapInListItem)

```

---

class: middle

```javascript

  return function(input) {

  }
}
input => {
  /* ... */
}
```

---

class: middle

```javascript

  /* ... */
}
