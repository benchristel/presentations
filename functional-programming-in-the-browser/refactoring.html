# Refactoring JavaScript for Radical Composability

???

My talk today is about two different types of program structure, and of course,
since I'm a very opinionated person, I'm going to make the argument that one of
these structures is better than the other.

In particular I want to talk about two different types of composition, which I'm
going to call Delegation and Radical Composition, for lack of a better term.

# Delegation

???

Delegation is extremely common in real-world code, and it basically looks like this:

---

class: center, middle

<div style="background-image:url(Delegation.jpg);" class="full-image"></div>

???

Dependency injection lets you loosen these hard links a little, so that you could in
theory swap out something else for B that implements the same interface.
The problem is that dependency injection actually perpetuates the tight coupling it's
supposed to fix, because now instead of hardcoded references you have a DI framework
that builds everything for you, so it's actually not easy to swap out module B. You have
to create a new dependency provider.

module A delegates some of its responsibility to module B, which delegates to C, and so on.

This type of code is easy to write but it has significant weaknesses.

One thing that should be fairly obvious is that A will not work if it doesn't have a B, and B won't work
if it doesn't have a C.

This prevents these modules from really being reusable.

Dependency injection frameworks let you loosen these
seams a little so you can unit test each module, and languages like Java give
you interfaces which help you depend on abstractions. But the promise of interfaces
doesn't really hold up when you have dependency injection.
Ideally, instead of A depending on a class B, it depends on an interface, and then
you can have multiple implementors of that interface that can be swapped out to
reconfigure the behavior of A. That's the ideal. But you hardly ever see it
in a production system, and the reason is that dependency injection perpetuates
the tight coupling it's supposed to solve. In a system with dep injection, if you need an instance of A,
you don't assemble it yourself, you ask the injector for it. So in order to swap out B
for a different implementation, you need a new dependency provider.

# Radical Composition

???

So that was Delegation. Let's talk about Radical Composition.

---

class: center, middle

<div style="background-image:url(Radical_Composition.jpg);" class="full-image"></div>

???

Radical composition looks like this. Instead of a deep dependency tree, we
have a wide flat one instead. Module A takes the other modules and somehow
plugs them into each other to do some work. But modules B, C, and D don't
know about each other at all. Because there's no dependency between these
three they're all reusuable, and you don't need dependency injection.
A can just create B C and D easily.

So that was very abstract. Let's look at some code. Along the way
we'll encounter some examples of why Radical Composition is preferable to Delegation.

---
class: middle

```javascript
function sortCustomersByName (customers) {
  customers.sort(function (a, b) {
    if (a.name > b.name) return 1
    if (a.name < b.name) return -1
    return 0
  })
}

function sortTransactionsByDate (transactions) {
  transactions.sort(function (a, b) {
    if (a.date > b.date) return 1
    if (a.date < b.date) return -1
    return 0
  })
}
```

???

And I'd like you to imagine that we're building an e-commerce site of some
description, and we have this page where we display sorted lists of customers
and transactions. So of course we have this javascript code. Customers
are sorted by name, and transactions are sorted by date.

And the way the sort API works in JavaScript is that you give the sort
method this comparator function that takes two elements from the array
and just returns an integer flag telling you which one is bigger. And
this function gets called repeatedly with different elements from the array
until the sort algorithm has determined the ordering for the entire list.

And obviously this code is almost the same in both cases, so it's a clear
candidate for refactoring. So let's just do the most obvious thing to
remove the duplication.

---
class: middle

```javascript
function sortBy (property, array) {
  array.sort(function (a, b) {
    if (a[property] > b[property]) return 1
    if (a[property] < b[property]) return -1
    return 0
  })
}

function sortCustomersByName (customers) {
  sortBy('name', customers)
}

function sortTransactionsByDate (transactions) {
  sortBy('date', transactions)
}
```

???

We can create a sortBy method that takes a property name and a list.
And this is about as DRY as we can get.

But this is delegation.

And there's a problem. Eventually, we will run into other types of sorting problems.
Maybe we need to sort in descending order somewhere, or maybe we need to sort by
multiple criteria at once. And those responsibilities will either get added to sortBy,
or sortBy will become dependent on some other, more general sorting function.

And that's bad because each time we add behavior to that general function, we risk
breaking what's already there.

So let's try a different approach. Instead of extracting a sortBy function, I'm going to extract just the idea of comparing by a property.

---
class: middle

```javascript
function makeComparator (property) {
  return function (a, b) {
    if (a[property] > b[property]) return 1
    if (a[property] < b[property]) return -1
    return 0
  }
}

function sortCustomersByName (customers) {
  customers.sort(makeComparator('name'))
}

function sortTransactionsByDate (transactions) {
  transactions.sort(makeComparator('date'))
}
```

???

So now we have this function makeComparator that, well, it makes a comparator function for us based on a property name.

---
class: middle

```javascript
function by (property) {
  return function (a, b) {
    if (a[property] > b[property]) return 1
    if (a[property] < b[property]) return -1
    return 0
  }
}

function sortCustomersByName (customers) {
  customers.sort(by('name'))
}

function sortTransactionsByDate (transactions) {
  transactions.sort(by('date'))
}
```

---
class: middle

```javascript
function by (property) {
  return function(a, b) {
    let aVal = a[property]
    let bVal = b[property]
    if (aVal > bVal) return 1
    if (aVal < bVal) return -1
    return 0
  }
}

// inlined
customers.sort(by('name'))

// inlined
transactions.sort(by('date'))
```

---
class: middle

```javascript
function by (getSortKey) {
  return function(a, b) {
    let aVal = getSortKey(a)
    let bVal = getSortKey(b)
    if (aVal > bVal) return 1
    if (aVal < bVal) return -1
    return 0
  }
}

function prop (propName) {
  return function (obj) {
    return obj[propName]
  }
}

// inlined
customers.sort(by(prop('name')))

// inlined
transactions.sort(by(prop('date')))
```

???

And now our `by` function is fully general, and perhaps more importantly, all the knowledge about what a customer or a transaction is and how to sort it is in one place. Before, this code down here knew that it was sorting customers, but this code up here knew that it was sorting some type of object. So the responsibility of knowing what we're sorting was previously sort of spread out, and now it's all concentrated down here.

Another nice outcome of this is that our prop function is generally useful, it's not just for sorting. For example, if we have a list of customers and we want all of their names, we can just do this:

---
class: middle

```javascript
customers.map(prop('name'))
```

???

customers map prop name. And I think this is really cool, because when we made `prop`, we didn't intend for it to compose with `map` this way. Like, actually, when I wrote the first draft of this talk, I didn't intend for this to happen. But I think this often happens when you break a program down into tiny units with laser-focused responsibilites--you end up with this kind of fortuitous composition.

---

class: middle

```javascript
function desc (comparator) {
  return function (a, b) {
    return -comparator(a, b)
  }
}
```

???

I call it `desc`. It takes a comparator, and returns a new comparator that inverts the old one. So whatever number was returned by comparing a and b, we just negate it, so now the sort goes in the other direction. And we can call it like this.

---
class: middle

```javascript
transactions.sort(desc(by(prop('date'))))
```

???

And now the parentheses look a little ugly but the PM's happy because you just shipped that fix in 5 minutes and you didn't have to change any existing code to do it.

---
class: center, middle

![Keep Calm and Compose All The Things](keep_calm_and_compose_all_the_things.png)

???

And this brings me to my final point which is that when you have these tiny, composable units of functionality, you actually can obey the open-closed principle in a way that would be really awkward to do with just OO.
