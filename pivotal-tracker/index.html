# Outline

- Why I'm giving this talk
--

- What is Pivotal Tracker?
--

- Why is Pivotal Tracker?
--

- The Elements of Tracker
  - An ordered backlog of user stories

--

- How does work get into the backlog?

--

- How does work get out of the backlog?

- Problems with Tracker

---

# Why This Talk?

--

- Not a sales pitch
- I don't think we should use Tracker

--

- This talk isn't really about Tracker, the software product

--

- It's about the culture that the software embodies, and the process it enables

--

- I don't even think we should use the whole Tracker _process_.

--

- I _do_ think the process is worth studying and learning from.

Automatic planning keeps your team in a rhythm. Get predictable and stay that way: Say goodbye to managing timelines and meeting unrealistic expectations, and let velocity do the planning.

???

A tool for communicating between engineering and "the business"

.breadcrumb[What is Tracker?]

# Tracker is like Jira

- Features and Bugs

--

- Epics and labels

--

- Story points

--

- Velocity

---

.breadcrumb[What is Tracker?]

# ...but Tracker is *not* Jira

--

- One view of the project. Everyone on the team sees the same thing when they look at Tracker.

--

- No sprint commitments. One continuous flow of value.

--

- Work items have no &ldquo;Priority&rdquo; field\*

--

- Work items can have up to 3 owners. This enables pair programming.

--

- A team has one backlog and one product owner.

---

# Why is Tracker?

---

.breadcrumb[Why is Tracker?]

# Pivotal Labs

- Software consulting company, 1989–2020
- &ldquo;Come work with us, in our office, on your project, and we'll teach you how to build software effectively.&rdquo;
- Tracker is the artifact that, more than any other, encodes the Pivotal Labs way of working in its structure.

???

re: "build software effectively", that means:
- pair programming
- shared code ownership

---

???

cross-functional collaboration

---

agile project planning - fixed budget or fixed scope, but not both

# *The* tool for project-related communication

- No Confluence

- No ADRs

- No email!

- No pull requests!

---

.breadcrumb[Why is Tracker?]

# Who is involved?

![venn diagram with 3 circles showing the overlapping concerns of PM, design, and engineering](pm-design-eng.png)

???

- Product: has authority to answer the question "what's valuable?"
- Design: has authority to answer the question "what's usable?"
- Engineering: has authority to answer the question "what's feasible?"

---

.breadcrumb[Why is Tracker?]

# What does Tracker make easier?

- building the right thing
- seeing progress
- planning efficiently
- forecasting when a feature will be ready
- exploring hypotheticals
- communicating
- answering questions about project history
- fun, joy, enthusiasm

???

building the right thing

gives business visibility into progress without sacrificing team autonomy

efficient planning that actually works (details later)

forecasts answers to the question "when will feature X be ready to release" so you can answer such 
questions immediately on demand

lets you easily explore hypotheticals ("what if we added two engineers to the team?" "what if we deprioritized this feature?") and see the effects on the release date

Tracker can be the source of truth for all project-related communication
    we didn't use slack or email

answering questions about project history like "why did we do it this way"

fun, joy, enthusiasm

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker]

### The Backlog

![tracker project](tracker-project-1.webp)

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker   >   The Backlog]

### One Queue, Many Cash Registers

![REI checkout](rei.webp)

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker   >   The Backlog]

### One Backlog, Many Workstations

![Pivotal Labs](labs4.jpg)

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker   >   The Backlog]

# Advantages of the one&#8209;backlog model

- The top-priority thing is always being worked on
- No time is spent assigning work to people
- Everyone has something to do
- You get to work on a variety of things
- Everyone is working on only one thing at a time

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker   >   The Backlog]

# Risks of the one&#8209;backlog model

- What if I don't know how to do the highest-priority thing?
- What if it's not my area of the codebase?
- What if I don't know what the requirements are?

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker]

# User Stories

- &ldquo;Features&rdquo;

--

- The smallest useful increment of functionality

--

- &ldquo;Minimum viable feature&rdquo;

--

- Something a user could test and give us feedback on

--

- A way of phrasing software requirements so everyone on the team can understand them

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker   >   User Stories]

## Parts of a (User) Story

--

- The motivation: a goal, problem, or conflict.

--

- The protagonist: a role or persona.

--

- The plot: what specifically does the user do?
  - this gives us the start of a test plan
  - A.K.A. Acceptance Criteria

--

- Illustrations: design mockups or sketches.

---

class: center, middle

# Motivation

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker   >   User Stories   >   Motivation]

## &ldquo;As an X, I want to Y, so that Z&rdquo;

_As a product manager, I want to click and drag stories to reprioritize them, so I can effortlessly communicate priorities to my team._<br><br>

--

_As a developer, I want to click &ldquo;start&rdquo; on a user story and have it update for everyone, so that no one else also starts working on it._<br><br>

--

.deemphasized[This pattern is named the [Connextra Template](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/user-story-template/), after the first company to use it.]

# Protagonist

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker   >   User Stories   >   Protagonist]

# Roles

- The capacity in which someone is using your product.

--

- Different roles have different goals.

--

- Examples:
  - Teacher
  - Parent
  - Learner
  - Donor
  - District Admin
  - Discussion Moderator
  - Content Author
  - Application Engineer
  - Site Reliability Engineer

???

A person is not their role. A given user can move between roles and even occupy multiple
roles simultaneously.

# Roles for Pivotal Tracker

- Product Manager
- Designer
- Engineer
- IT administrator
- Client Product Owner
- Client Liaison
- Pivotal Labs Office Director

# Plot

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker   >   User Stories   >   Plot]

# Acceptance Criteria

- A test plan that we write before the work starts
- Ensures that the feature can actually be tested! I.e. it actually has some reliable, perceptible effect from some user's perspective.
- &ldquo;Acceptance&rdquo; means the PM or QE running through the test plan and signing off on the work.

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker   >   User Stories   >   Plot]

# Gherkin

- A semi-structured language for writing acceptance criteria
- GIVEN, WHEN, THEN

```gherkin
Given I am logged in as an admin
When I visit "/devadmin"
Then I see a link titled "Content Editor"

When I click "Content Editor"
Then I am taken to "/devadmin/content"
And I see a list of courses
```

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker   >   User Stories   >   Plot]

# Gherkin

- GIVEN = preconditions. "Arrange"
- WHEN = action. "Act"
- THEN = how you know it worked. "Assert"

---

class: center, middle

***Communicating requirements is more important than syntax!***

???

Gherkin was invented as a semi-structured language for writing user acceptance tests.

The idea of a user acceptance test is that a non-technical person (the user or customer) writes them
in Gherkin, and then developers work behind the scenes to translate the Gherkin statements into
executable code using templates. There are tools for doing this, e.g. the Cucumber testing framework.

The problem with acceptance tests is that customers and users don't seem to care about them in
practice.

# Putting it all together

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker   >   User Stories]

# User story example

> Feature: User story workflow button
>
> As a developer using Pivotal Tracker, I want to let my team know what story I'm working on,
> so that no one else also works on it.
> 
> **Given** I am logged into Tracker<br>
> And my project has a user story that is not yet started<br>
> **When** I click the "start" button on the story<br>
> **Then** the button turns blue<br>
> And the text changes to "deliver"<br>
> And the background of the story card changes to yellow, meaning "in progress"
>
> **When** I log in as a different team member<br>
> **Then** I still see that the story is in progress

# User story example, cont'd

A design mockup is worth a thousand words.

![design mockup for this feature, showing the start and finish buttons](tracker-story-mock.png)

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker   >   User Stories]

# Advantages of writing stories this way

- each piece of work creates demonstrable value for an identifiable segment of your audience (the persona)
- the scope of the work is clearer to everyone involved

---

.breadcrumb[The Elements of Tracker   >   User Stories]

# Risks of writing stories this way

- using the template without fulfilling its purpose
- waste of effort when the team already knows what to do
- the "fog of formality" from the structured format can make the story _harder_ to understand

---

## What about work that isn't a user story?

Don't worry, Tracker has an answer for that too.

# How work gets into the backlog

---

.breadcrumb[How work gets into the backlog]

# It's a whole process

- talk to / observe people and find out what they need
--

- product vision (loosely held)
--

- user stories
--

- UX design
--

- UI design
--

- acceptance criteria
--

- estimation
--

- prioritization

???

At the beginning of this process, product is more involved. In the middle, design is more involved.
Throughout the process, engineers give feedback about cost/value tradeoffs
(most formally in the estimation step, but ideally at all points from product vision onward)

It's important to note that these are not waterfall-style phases. We don't do user research
for the whole product and then design the whole product and write all the user stories
and then start development. You want to be pushing small increments of value through this
pipeline as fast as possible so you can get feedback faster.

---

.breadcrumb[How work gets into the backlog]

# It's a whole process

- talk to / observe people and find out what they need
- product vision (loosely held)
- ~~user stories~~
- UX design
- UI design
- ~~acceptance criteria~~
- estimation
- prioritization

???

We've already discussed user stories and acceptance criteria

---

.breadcrumb[How work gets into the backlog]

# It's a whole process

- ~~talk to / observe people and find out what they need~~
- ~~product vision (loosely held)~~
- ~~user stories~~
- ~~UX design~~
- ~~UI design~~
- ~~acceptance criteria~~
- estimation
- prioritization

???

and these other things are beyond the scope of this talk.
So let's talk about estimation.

---

.breadcrumb[How work gets into the backlog]

# Estimation

- Tracker measures the relative "size" of work items in **story&nbsp;points**.

--

- Story points combine estimates of risk, complexity, and effort, all of which correlate with time.

--

- While we're bad at estimating how long something will take, estimating _relative size_ is easier.

--

- A team, working sustainably over time, will deliver a fairly consistent number of story points every week. The average story points per week is the team's _velocity_.

---

.breadcrumb[How work gets into the backlog]

# Estimation

- To avoid quibbling over story points and decouple estimates mentally from time, Tracker forces estimates to be approximate by "bucketizing" them into a small set of values.

![small, medium, and large buckets](sml-400.jpg)

---

.breadcrumb[How work gets into the backlog]

# Estimation

Several point scales are in use:

- linear: 0, 1, 2, 3

--
- fibonacci: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

--
- exponential: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8

--
- sparse fibonacci: 0, 1, 3, 8

--
- custom: 1, 5, 25, 125

--

The only thing you can't do in Tracker is make the "estimate" field a free-entry number input.

---

.breadcrumb[How work gets into the backlog]

# Why estimate?

- Predict how long a whole project will take
- Predict when a given feature will be ready
- Have a conversation about what's involved in implementation

---

# \#NoEstimates

A team has a velocity - an average number of story points they deliver per week.

A team also has an average story size

Divide velocity by story size, and you get stories per week

If velocity is stable, and average story size is stable, then counting stories should give you the same forecasts as estimating with story points!

And indeed it does.

Stories per week averages out over time and can be used for long-term forecasting

...but not for short-term forecasting.

---

# Volatility

- A measure of how much a team's velocity varies from week to week

- You want volatility to be low so you can make accurate short-term forecasts.

- volatility = stddev(velocity) / average(velocity) * 100%
