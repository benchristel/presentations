Tracker in theory

- velocity is calculated automatically
- date markers get automatically added to the backlog each week
- the backlog is ordered. Things get done in order.
- release markers go in the backlog after the last story that is blocking that release. They have a scheduled date and turn red if the date is predicted to slip.

Tracker in practice

Why:

- I've used elements of the Tracker Way on projects I've led, and people seem to like it.
- It's a great starting point for thinking about how to organize and manage a project, even if you're not using Tracker itself.
